## ‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è Pipelines

- __`1.`__ End-to-End ELT & AI pipeline for processing and analysis of semi-structured HL7 FHIR R4 JSON messages with __Snowflake Snowpark, Cortex Analyst and Streamlit in Snowflake__. A conversational Streamlit Chat App that calls Cortex Analyst REST API with a configured semantic model allows users to interact with HL7 FHIR R4 extracted resources that include patient information, medical encounters, conditions/diagnoses, medications and insurance claims using natural language question-asking. Cortex Analyst assists with both financial analysis of healthcare costs as well as clinical analysis of diagnoses, treatment and patient care patterns. Cortex Analyst generated queries are optimized and refactored into materialized views giving persistent, pre-aggregated data for fast downstream queries and read-heavy workloads.
 
- __`2.`__ End-to-End ELT data pipeline for processing semi-structured HL7 FHIR R4 JSON messages into a structured representation to facilitate role-based data protection of sensitive information, analysis and visualization with __SnowSQL CLI client, Snowflake SQL, functions, dynamic data masking and Streamlit in Snowflake notebook__.

- __`3.`__ Semi-structured JSON data ingestion from clinicaltrials.gov REST API into Snowflake making use of __Snowflake external access integration and a Python-based UDF function to fetch data from REST API endpoint__.
